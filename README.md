##  Exported Values

## Function Airtys
forEach() – 2 aritys: callback and currentValue (though this method can also include index and array for a total of 4 parameters);
map() – 1 arity: callback;
filter() - 2 aritys: currentValue and thisValue;
reduce() – 2 aritys: callback and accumulator;



In your `README.md`, describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include its arity (expected number of parameters the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and its behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to add any additional information in your `README.md` that you would like.
