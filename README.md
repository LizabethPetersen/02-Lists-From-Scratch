##  Exported Values
This is incomplete. And this is a test. And this is another test.

## Function Airtys
I'll be honest in saying I am unsure what is desired for this section. I am guessing the following:
forEach() – 2 airtys, callback and currentValue (though this method can also include index and array for a total of 4 parameters);
map() – 1 airty, callback;
filter() - 2 airtys, currentValue and thisValue;
reduce() – 2 airtys, callback and accumulator;



In your `README.md`, describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include its airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and its behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to add any additional information in your `README.md` that you would like.
