#02: Tools and Context

##  Exported Values
I have defined a general list module which takes in any arguments passed into it. The list class has one argument, which is its length.


## Function Aritys
- forEach() – 1 aritys: callback. This method can also include current, index, and array for a total of 4 aritys (parameters).
- map() – 1 arity: callback;
- filter() - 2 aritys: callback and result; the filter() method can take in an argument to essentially "filter" through the data to return a particular set of data.
- reduce() – 2 aritys: callback and accumulator.
